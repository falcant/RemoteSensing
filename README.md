# RemoteSensing
The following project is based on  UC merced Land Use data set. There are 21 classes of different lands areas. Each class conssits of 100 images of size 256x256 pixels. The main goal of this project is to construct and train a Neural Network that help us classify different land areas. 
## Initial Problem
Classification of land use of satellite images for a small dataset.
## Required
•	Go over any questions from CS231 Convolutional Neural network course.
•	Install Python & PyTorch.  Make sure that the code from the “Warm-up: numpy” and “PyTorch Tensors” from https://github.com/jcjohnson/pytorch-examples works.
•	Make sure to go through what the “Warm-up: numpy” and “PyTorch Tensors”:
